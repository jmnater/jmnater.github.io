'Nobody knows this little Rose &mdash;
It might a pilgrim be
Did I not take it from the ways
And lift it up to thee.
Only a Bee will miss it &mdash;
Only a Butterfly,
Hastening from far journey &mdash;
On its breast to lie &mdash;
Only a Bird will wonder &mdash;
Only a Breeze will sigh &mdash;
Ah little Rose &mdash; how easy
For such as thee to die!'>
